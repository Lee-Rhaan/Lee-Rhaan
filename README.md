## Summary:
>Get to know me:
- _The language I wrote my first program in was Batch, which is a scripting language I've used to create viruses, text based games, the
matrix green screens etc., it's basically what sparked this interest to further pursue programming as a career._
- _This was back in 2013/14, and I've managed to keep that passion alive for all these years._
